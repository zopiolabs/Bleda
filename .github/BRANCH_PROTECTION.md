See `.github/scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` for the automated setup script.

## Verifying Protection Rules

Run the verification workflow to ensure all rules are properly configured:

```bash
gh workflow run verify-protection.yml
```

Or check manually:

```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection
```

## Core Team Members

The following users/teams have direct push access to the main branch:

- `@zopiolabs/core` - Core infrastructure team

See `.github/CODEOWNERS` for detailed code ownership assignments.

## Exceptions and Emergency Procedures

### Bypassing Protection (Emergency Only)

In case of critical production issues:

1. Create a hotfix branch from main
2. Apply the fix
3. Create an emergency PR with `[HOTFIX]` prefix
4. Request expedited review from core team
5. Merge with admin override if absolutely necessary

### Temporary Rule Modifications

For special releases or maintenance:

1. Document the reason in an issue
2. Temporarily modify rules via Settings
3. Restore original rules immediately after
4. Update this document if permanent changes are needed

## Monitoring and Compliance

- Weekly automated audit of protection rules (see `.github/workflows/audit-protection.yml`)
- Notifications sent to core team for any rule modifications
- Monthly review of CODEOWNERS assignments
